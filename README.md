# Library Management System - REST API

This is a library management system fullstack project (back-end part) I made in Integrify fullstack program. From this project, I practiced how to write a REST API using Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript and connect to MongoDB database. I gained deep understanding about REST API, routing, controller and security through this project.
